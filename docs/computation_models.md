## Alt Computing Models

- Physical limitations present a fundamental roadblock to ever-increasing processor clock speeds.
- Because power density increases superlinearly with clock speed, chips run the risk of melting once their clock speed becomes high enough.
- In order to perform more computations per second, chips are being designed to contain several processing "cores".
- Multi-core computers can framed as a type of "parallel computer".
- In order to achieve the best possible performance from multicore computers, algorithms need to be designed with parallelism in mind.
