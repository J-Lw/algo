## Algo Problem Types

- Algorithms solve computational problems beyond sorting.

#### Practical Algorithm Applications
- Sequencing 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA, storing data, and data analysis all require unique algos.
- Dynamic programming is heavily relied upon in such realms, particularly for solving problems that involve determining similarity between DNA sequences.
- In such scenarios, DP enables greater time and resource efficiency.
- Search engines are dependant on algorithms to quickly find specific pages.
- Public-key cryptography amd digital signatures enable safe electronic commerce, such infrastructure are based on numerical algorithms and number theory.
