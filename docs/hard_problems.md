## Hard Problems

- An algorithms speed is usually used to measure its effiency, but there exists problems for which there exists no algorithm that runs in a reasonable amount of time.
- Problems of this type are known as NP-complete.
- Although no efficient algorithm for an NP-complete problem has ever been found, it has never been proven that an efficient algorithm for one cannot exist.
- Remarkably, if an efficient algorithm exists for a single NP-complete problem, an efficient solution exists for the entire set of NP-complete problems.
- NP-complete problems can be similar, but not identical, to problems for which efficient algorithms do exist.
- NP-complete problems are important to be aware of as they can arise in real world applications.
- Developing an efficient approximation algorithm is common practice when encountering NP-complete problems.
- An example of an NP-complete problem is the travelling salesman problem.
